1.1      BACKGROUND
 

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean that for many years has been plagued with persistent water shortages especially in urban and suburban areas. This situation is however not due to the shortage of rainfall but to inadequacies in the catchment and distribution of water. Jamaica was aptly called Xamaica by its original inhabitants, which means land of wood and water. It is therefore ironic that this would be a country plagued with water shortage. For many years the government’s solution for the existing problem has been to institute a system of water lock-offs to conserve water. This has led to tremendous hardship for citizens especially those who live in the urban area and for farmers in rural areas, causing decreased yields from crops, crop damage in urban, rural and in suburban areas, and caused considerable damage to flowers and gardens. Overall, water scarcity has negatively impacted people’s general way of life, forcing them to plan their normal activities around water lookoffs.

This project proposes to alleviate some of the issues faced by the consumers, by, (1) Decreasing dependence on water from the National Water Commission (NWC) through the harvesting of rainwater for the watering of plants; (2) Reducing cost while helping with the overall conservation through automatic scheduling and distribution, depending on plant need and soil condition.


1.2      OBJECTIVES
 

§  implement the storage of both rainwater and NWC water.

§  system should be able to use soil moisture content to decide on watering needs

§  system should be able to set the time of watering based on crop need.

§  supply rainwater to watering area as long as it is available.

§  The system should be able to recognize when the rainwater tank is at a critical level and automatically switch to the NWC water supply (tank)

§  The system should via a website inform the consumer of the state of the system and allow for virtual reset and overrides.

 

1.3      IMPLEMENTATION AND METHODOLOGY
 

This project will require the collection and storage of both NWC and rainwater. It will check the moisture content using sensors and weather condition to make decisions on the commencement and or termination of watering. This decision is to be achieved by the switching on and off the appropriate pump and valves based on the availability of rainwater.  The system will water three different zones at different scheduled time for period appropriate to the type of plant. This will be set by the user and can be set and reset remotely as necessary.  

 The system via a mobile application will keep the user informed about the state of the system and provide the ability to ret reset or disable the system.


SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS
 

The system should be able to store rainwater and NWC water. It should distribute rainwater when available and NWC water when it not. It should use soil moisture content and weather data to make watering discissions It should enable user interface remotely allowing the user to set, reset, enable and disable the system as necessary.
